Manipulating Pixels!

Hello fellow human being! The majority of my codes are documented in Brazilian Portuguese, but if you take some interest in any of them,

I'm also looking for any kind of professional experience, I would be glad to help in any project of sorts.
My area of expertise includes:

Java (Junior);
C++ (Manipulating Pixels);
Android (Both xml and java, Junior);
